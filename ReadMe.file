Key Features:
Levels with Increasing Difficulty:

The game starts at level 1 with a 3x3 grid and 1 mine. As the levels progress, both the grid size and the number of mines increase. The game progresses up to level 5 with a 7x7 grid and 5 mines.
Colorful and Responsive UI:

The background colors for the window, buttons, and revealed cells are chosen for a visually pleasing experience:
Alice Blue for the main window background.
Lavender for cells that show the number of surrounding mines.
Light Cyan for revealed empty cells.
Red for mines when the game is over.
Flagging and Revealing Mechanism:

Players can right-click to place a flag on suspected mines (displayed as a red flag on a light yellow background).
Left-click reveals the contents of a cell, showing the number of surrounding mines or triggering the end of the game if a mine is clicked.
End Game Alerts:

The game displays a message when the player hits a mine or completes a level. It either moves to the next level or shows a congratulatory message when all levels are completed.
Centered Text:

The numbers indicating nearby mines are centered within their respective buttons, ensuring clarity.

Sets up the game board based on the current level.

Revealing and Counting (reveal, count_mines_around):

Reveals cells recursively if they have no adjacent mines and counts how many mines are around each revealed cell.
End Conditions (check_win, game_over, win_game):
